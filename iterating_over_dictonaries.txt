Dictionary Loop and String Formatting
Here is an example that combines a dictionary loop with string formatting. The loop iterates over the dictionary and it generates and prints out a string in each iteration:



phone_numbers = {"John": "+37682929928", "Marry": "+423998200919"}
 
for pair in phone_numbers.items():
    print(f"{pair[0]} has as phone number {pair[1]}")


And here is a better way to achieve the same results by iterating over keys and values:

phone_numbers = {"John": "+37682929928", "Marry": "+423998200919"}
 
for key, value in phone_numbers.items():
    print(f"{key} has as phone number {value}")


In both cases, the output is:

John has as phone number +37682929928

Marry has as phone number +423998200919

Q: Loop Over Dictionary and Replace
Loop over the phone_numbers values and in each loop print out the phone number, but with '00' instead of '+'. In other words, your code should output:

0037682929928

00423998200919

Hint: You can access dictionary values with phone_numbers.values() and you can replace characters using str.replace() .

A:

phone_numbers = {"John Smith": "+37682929928", "Marry Simpons": "+423998200919"}

for numbers in phone_numbers.values():
    print(numbers.replace("+","00"))
